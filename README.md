Snake bites cause more than 100 000 deaths and more than 300 000
permanent disfigurements every year, caused by toxin proteins in snake
venom. Injury and death from snake bites is more common in poor
socioeconomic conditionss and has historically received limited funding
for discovery, development, and delivery of new treatment options.

Currently,
 the only effective treatment against snakebite envenoming consists of
unspecified cocktails of polyclonal antibodies extracted from immunised
production animals.These antivenom antibodies work unreliably across
different species of snake, and until recently little data existed on
which of the 2000+ snake venom toxins they bind, as well as where the
binding of the antibody to the toxin occurs.

To address this issue, a [recent study](https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0008366)
 used high-density peptide microarray (HDPM) technology with all
currently available African snake toxin protein sequences, together with
 eight commercial antivenoms in clinical use in Africa to better
understand how antivenoms bind to specific snake venom toxins.

In
this challenge, you are tasked to build a machine learning model to
predict how strongly a given string of amino acids from a snake venom
toxin protein binds to eight different commercial antivenom antibodies.

Your
 solutions will help predict what other toxins a given antivenom could
be effective against (or neutralise), rapidly improving patient
treatment. In the long term, this work leads to a whole new generation
of snake bite treatments based on specific engineered antibodies -
understanding where antibodies might bind a given toxin will ultimately
contribute to this work.
